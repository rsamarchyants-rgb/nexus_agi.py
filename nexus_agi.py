# AGI "Nexus" v5.0

**A self-learning artificial intelligence system for dynamic knowledge synthesis based on first principles of science, philosophy, and art.**

This project is the intellectual property of its author, protected by the MIT License.

## 💡 About The Project

AGI "Nexus" is not just a program, but a conceptual framework for an artificial intelligence capable of true interdisciplinary synthesis. It operates on a dynamic, weighted knowledge graph, allowing it to find non-obvious analogies between disparate domains — from quantum physics and biology to geometry and music.

The system is designed to evolve its own understanding of reality by formulating principles, generating verifiable scientific hypotheses, and even engaging in creative synthesis.

## ✨ Key Features

* **Dynamic Knowledge Graph:** Integrates concepts from multiple domains with weighted relationships.
* **Self-Learning Cycle:** Continuously analyzes the graph to identify fundamental principles.
* **Confidence Scoring:** Evaluates its own hypotheses with a calculated confidence level.
* **Hypothesis Generation:** Formulates new, testable scientific hypotheses based on its findings.
* **Creative Synthesis:** Capable of generating simple creative works (e.g., music) based on derived principles.
* **Legally Framed:** The source code is protected by the MIT license, securing the author's rights.

## 🚀 How to Use

1.  Ensure you have Python and the `networkx` library installed (`pip install networkx`).
2.  Save this code as `nexus_agi.py`.
3.  Run the script from your terminal:
    ```bash
    python nexus_agi.py
    ```
4.  The script will output its reasoning cycle, derived principles, and generated hypotheses.
